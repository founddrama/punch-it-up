# PUNCH IT UP!

Do you have a client that is telling you that your design is lacking a certain... pizzazz? Well, here's a bookmarklet to instantly PUNCH IT UP!

### fine print
OK, so this is in its really early stages. Like... "I spent 15 minutes on it after lunch" early stages. So please contribute post-haste before I go and actually start telling people about this. What should it do? I don't know yet but here are a few random ideas I had:

* randomly select elements (e.g., `html a` the first time, `html div` the next, and so on...)
* randomly apply colors
* randomly apply styles

...whatever it takes to PUNCH IT UP!
